This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Set up and `.env.development` file in the root of your server which looks like
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ETH_GATEWAY=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your_infura_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_OUTPOST_API=http://localhost:4000
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAGIC_KEY=optional_magic_key
```

If you want to be able to sign in with email, you'll need to get a magic key from [magic](https://magic.link)

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
